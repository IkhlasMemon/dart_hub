# dart_hub

A GitHub client written in flutter. The goal of this project is to build something non-trivial in Flutter to flex the framework's muscles.

## Building

In order to build this project, you'll need to add a `keys.dart` file to the `lib/` directory of this project.
This file contains the oauth client id and client secret necessary to communicate with the GitHub apis.
Inside the file you'll need to define two constants:
```dart
const String CLIENT_ID = 'your oauth client id';
const String CLIENT_SECRET = 'your oauth client secret';
```
You can create an oauth api project [here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
